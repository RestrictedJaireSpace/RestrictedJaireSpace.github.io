Well folks, you know me, I love to make memes. Unfortunately the laptop I use to make memes is severly outdated, which makes editing and rendering a pain and makes some memes that I'd like to make just downright impossible. 

I don't really **need** a better computer for my job or personal life, just this hobby. As it would be difficult to explain to my wife that I splurged over $1000 on desktop setup because I'm a self-proclaimed 'Meme Lord', I'd be grateful if you chipped in. Anything I don't spend will be donated to Doctors Without Borders.
